This repo is an example of a team project repository that meets all of [the repository requirements](https://www.notion.so/CSC-Hacks-901a62e005c8494fa342e0cc738101ad#da206965e3ed497f9bd6c1ceebd4fac9).

## Project Description
* I want to make a LED display using arduino
* I want to do this because I don't know how librarys or arduino really works
* Doing this will require learning opencv, arduino, and how to make arduino have more output then it really has.
* I anticipate the following challenges: 
  * learning how to use opencv or another video,image processing library in arduino or something in tandum
  * Making a circuit with that many LEDs
